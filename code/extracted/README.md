This directory contains extracted Scala snippets taken from markdown/posts.
They are intentionally not part of the build classpath to avoid compiling
partial snippets. If you want to compile or run a snippet, copy it into
`src/main/scala` and wrap it into a valid Scala source (package/object/etc.).

Files moved here:
