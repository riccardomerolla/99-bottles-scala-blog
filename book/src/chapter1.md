# Chapter 1: Introduction to Effect-Oriented Programming

## What is Effect-Oriented Programming?

Effect-oriented programming is an approach to software development that emphasizes modeling side effects as values. Rather than immediately executing operations with side effects, we represent these operations as data structures that can be composed, transformed, and executed at a later time.

## Why Effect-Oriented Programming?

Traditional imperative programming mixes business logic with side effects, making code:

- Hard to test
- Difficult to reason about
- Challenging to compose
- Prone to concurrency issues

Effect-oriented programming addresses these problems by making effects explicit and separating the description of a computation from its execution.

## Enter ZIO

ZIO is a library for effect-oriented programming in Scala that provides a powerful abstraction for managing effects. With ZIO, effects are represented as values with the type `ZIO[R, E, A]`, where:

- `R` represents the environment required to run the effect
- `E` represents the error type that might be produced
- `A` represents the success type that might be produced

```scala
import zio._

// An effect that requires Console, might fail with IOException, and produces a String
val readLine: ZIO[Console, IOException, String] = Console.readLine
```
